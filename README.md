## Extra information on the Bachelor and Master projects
Both levels of projects are expected to take around 6 months to complete.
A Bachelor project should be doable with an engagement of ~10 hours per week and is worth 9 ECTS, while it is expected that a Masters project will require ~30 hours per week (for 30 ETCS). 
In essence a Bacherlor project is an extra subject during the semester, while the Masters project is the equivalent of a full semesters work.
