## Project description

"First Light" for any new telescope is a very special occasion.
It is the first time a whole new system is tested on-sky and the very first time astronomers can see what the telescope is capable of.
Additionally the first light image will be the centrepiece of the celebratory press conferences and will be displayed on every astronomy-related Youtube channel and Reddit group.   
So what will be the first iamge taken with the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) when it comes online in 2028?

Three instruments are competing to be the first light instrument on the ELT: MICADO, METIS, and HARMONI.
Each instrument has different use cases and different capabilities.
Hence each instrument will have a different "perfect" first light target.

The goals of this Bachelor project are to:
- identify potential targets for each of the first generation instruments
- simulate the potential first light observations using the ELT observation simulator (ScopeSim) developed at our institute.
