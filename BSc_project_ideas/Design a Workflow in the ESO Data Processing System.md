**Expected duration**: 6 months


## Project description

ESO is upgrading their data processing stack for the ELT. In particular, they are developing the ESO Data Processing System (EDPS). The University of Vienna is responsible for writing EDPS pipelines for METIS, one of the first three instruments on the ELT.

This project will have you:

- Learn how to write a data processing pipeline in the ESO Data Processing System.
- Create several small pipelines to test the new capabilities of the system, and learn why these are necessary to achieve the best science with the ELT.
- Be prepared for when the ELT comes online!
