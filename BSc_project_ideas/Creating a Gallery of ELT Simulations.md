# Creating a Gallery of ELT Science Case Simulations

**Title**: Creating a Gallery of ELT Science Case Simulations

**Status**: Available from 1st October 2023

**Supervisor**: Dr. Hugo Buddelmeijer (Univ. Vienna)

**Contact information**: hugo.buddelmeijer@univie.ac.at

**Expected duration**: 6 months


## Project description

The ELT has a variety of key science cases, and theseneed to be simulated with Scope-SIM (developed at the University of Vienna).

Simulating this data ensures that

- Scientists know what their key science data will look like, and that
- ScopeSIM has the capabilities of producing this data, and communicates how to do so.

This project can therefore be approached from three different perspectives:

- Scientific: Can we achieve with the ELT what we set out to do?
- Techological: Can ScopeSIM simulate what we need it to?
- Outreach: How to best communicate the capabilities of the ELT / ScopeSIM to fellow scientists?
